## Demonstration:

 
## Objective:
### Task 1: Setting up the Flask application
* Create a **new Flask application** and set up the **necessary packages and modules.**
* **Create a virtual environment** for the application.
* **Connect your Flask application** with the Database (MySQL preferably.)
### Task 2: Error Handling
* **Implement error handling** for your API to ensure that it returns proper error messages and status codes.
* **Create error handlers*** for ex. 400, 401, 404, 500, and any other errors that you feel
are necessary.
* Make sure that error messages are **returned in a consistent format.**
### Task 3: Authentication
* Implement **authentication** for your **API** using **JWT.**
* **Create a user model** with username and password fields.
* **Implement a login endpoint** that authenticates the user and **returns a JWT token.**
* **Implement a protected endpoint** that requires a valid JWT token to access.
### Task 4: File Handling
* **Implement file handling** for your API to allow users to upload files.
* **Create an endpoint** that allows users to upload files. 
* **Implement file validation** to ensuree that files are uploading within the eallowed file size limit.
* **Store uploaded files** in a secure location. (A folder in your project's folder structure.)
### Task 5: Public Route
* **Create a public route** that allows users to view public information.
* **Implement an endpoint** that returns a list of items that can be **viewed pubicly.**
* Ensure that this **endpoint does not require authentication.**
